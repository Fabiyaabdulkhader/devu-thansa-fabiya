### Project Description

Emergency Supporting System is a web-based application designed to help individuals in emergency situations by providing quick access to support services, real-time location sharing, and SOS alerts.

### The Problem Statement

Emergencies can happen anytime, and finding immediate help can be challenging. People often struggle to communicate their exact location and access emergency resources quickly.

### The Solution

We provide a **one-click SOS system** with **real-time location tracking** using OpenStreetMap, emergency contacts, and a database to store SOS requests. The system ensures **quick response** in critical situations.
